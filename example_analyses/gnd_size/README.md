# Analysis of Population and Area of Grama Niladhari Divisions

## What is a Grama Niladhari Division (GND)?

A Grama Niladhari Division is the smallest administrative unit in Sri Lanka, forming the base of the national governance structure under a Divisional Secretariat. Each GND represents a defined community or village area and is assigned a unique official code. These divisions ensure that government administration reaches every locality, connecting the public directly to state services.

## Role and Importance of the Grama Niladhari

The Grama Niladhari is the government’s representative at village level, responsible for maintaining population records, issuing certificates, coordinating welfare programs, and reporting on local conditions. They assist with law and order, disaster response, and community development. This position is crucial for effective, people-centered governance, ensuring that state functions operate efficiently at the grassroots.

## Delimitation and Boundary Changes

GND boundaries are defined based on population, geography, and community identity within a Divisional Secretariat Division. The delimitation process is overseen by the Ministry of Public Administration and the Department of Census and Statistics, with changes legally formalized through Government Gazette notifications. Boundaries may be redrawn when populations grow, new settlements emerge, or administrative efficiency demands adjustments.

## Importance of Balanced Area and Population

A GND must be of a manageable size so that one Grama Niladhari can effectively serve all residents. If an area is too large, services become less accessible and administration less responsive. Similarly, overpopulated GNDs strain welfare distribution, data accuracy, and local coordination. Balanced boundaries ensure equitable representation, efficient data collection, and fair allocation of resources.

## Addressing Oversized GNDs

When a GND becomes too large in area or population, it can be divided into two or more smaller divisions. This allows for better administrative coverage and more direct engagement with residents. Such adjustments are typically initiated by the Divisional Secretary and formalized through the Ministry of Public Administration to maintain effective governance at the community level.
