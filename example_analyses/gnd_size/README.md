# Analysis of Population and Area of Grama Niladhari Divisions

## What is a GND?
A Grama Niladhari Division (GND) is Sri Lanka’s smallest administrative unit, created to bring government services and record-keeping closer to every village and community.

## Role of the Grama Niladhari
The Grama Niladhari is the state’s village-level officer, maintaining records, issuing certificates, coordinating welfare, and ensuring law, order, and development at the grassroots.

## Delimitation and Boundaries
GNDs are delimited by the Ministry of Public Administration using population, geography, and access factors; boundary changes are gazetted after official review and approval.

## Why Size Matters
Reasonable GND size ensures each officer can manage data, services, and welfare effectively, keeping administration accessible and representation balanced across all areas.
